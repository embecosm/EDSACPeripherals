	This is the definitive paper tape reader as demonstrated at FOSDEM
	2018.  Content is now recognized as EDSAC modified Baudot code
	used for input (note, not the same as the representation for
	output).

	* order-generator/printcode/printcode.ino (void setup): Correctly
	place the leader message.
	* papertape-reader/code/reader/reader.ino (SPROCKET_PIN): Move
	sprocket pin to be A2.
	(seekingOrder, struct ChMap, hash, addHash, lookupOrder)
	(lookupNum, initHash): Created.
	(setup): Call initHash, intialize seekingOrder state
	(loop): Interpret input as EDSAC order codes, printing each
	completed code.

	This is the definitive printer.  Actual programs are defined as
	a string of EDSAC order mnemonics towards the top of the program.

	* order-generator/printcode/printcode.ino: Generate EDSAC baudot
	code, recognizing just the EDSAC input character set.

	* order-generator/printcode/printcode.ino: Produce output in the
	correct format - move sprocket hole one across.
	* papertape-reader/signal-trace.ods: Final version.

	This is the fully working reader of paper tape.  A full data log
	is included for tutuorial purposes.

	At present this reads as plain 5 bit binary.  Future work will add
	correct EDSAC modified baudot decoding.

	A ChangeLog is added now there is significant updating to software
	in progress.

	* ChangeLog: Created.
	* papertape-reader/code/reader/reader.ino: Rewritten for a simpler
	analysis and using the correct line as sprocket.
	* papertape-reader/signal-trace.ods: Created.
