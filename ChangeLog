	This is the definitive printer.  Actual programs are defined as
	a string of EDSAC order mnemonics towards the top of the program.

	* order-generator/printcode/printcode.ino: Generate EDSAC baudot
	code, recognizing just the EDSAC input character set.

	* order-generator/printcode/printcode.ino: Produce output in the
	correct format - move sprocket hole one across.
	* papertape-reader/signal-trace.ods: Final version.

	This is the fully working reader of paper tape.  A full data log
	is included for tutuorial purposes.

	At present this reads as plain 5 bit binary.  Future work will add
	correct EDSAC modified baudot decoding.

	A ChangeLog is added now there is significant updating to software
	in progress.

	* ChangeLog: Created.
	* papertape-reader/code/reader/reader.ino: Rewritten for a simpler
	analysis and using the correct line as sprocket.
	* papertape-reader/signal-trace.ods: Created.
