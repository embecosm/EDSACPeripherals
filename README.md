Individual parts have their own readmes where you can find bills of materials and suggested suppliers, however all parts need wire, which can be purchased  at a large selection of [online](http://uk.farnell.com/c/cable-wire-cable-assemblies/hook-up-wire-single-conductor?wire-gauge=22awg), [nationanl chain](https://www.maplin.co.uk/p/maplin-06-mm-solid-copper-core-22-awg-2-amp-bell-wire-10m-black-bl85g) and local retailers\.
Our parts lists specify parts required for using ATMega328 \(as used in the Arduino Uno\) microcontrollers to drive the peripherals\, but you can use a wide range of different microcontrollers if you wish\. We used [Embecosm USB to UART converters](www.embecosm.com/resources/hardware/#EHW5), but since these are not widely available\, you will have to use a commercially available alternative if you use a controller without one built in\, of which there are many\.
