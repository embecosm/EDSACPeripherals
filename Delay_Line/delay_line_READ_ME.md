This is the folder for the current delay line prototype.

simple_code.ino is the code for the simple design. The code works and the CLK value can be changed to make the delay line faster or slower. If too fast the information sent will be lost.

interrupt_test.ino shows how the passive buzzer could be used. The problem with this design was that the microphone could not sense the sound waves fast enough.
